  "llm_feedback": "**Analysis and Suggestions**\n\nThe provided Python code is for a FastAPI application. Here's a breakdown of the code and suggestions for improvement:\n\n### Import Statements\n\nThe import statements are clear and concise. However, it's a good practice to consider using an `__init__.py` file in the `.routes` directory to avoid polluting the namespace.\n\n```python\n# In routes/__init__.py\nfrom .analyzer_route import analyzer_router\nfrom .coach_route import coach_router\n```\n\nThen, in the main file:\n\n```python\nfrom .routes import analyzer_router, coach_router\n```\n\n### Application Setup\n\nThe application setup is good, but consider adding error handling for the CORS middleware.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    app.add_middleware(\n        CORSMiddleware,\n        allow_origins=[\"http://localhost:5173\"],  # ONLY your frontend domain\n        allow_credentials=True,\n        allow_methods=[\"*\"],\n        allow_headers=[\"*\"],\n    )\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"CORS middleware setup failed: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Route Registration\n\nThe route registration is correct. However, consider adding a check to ensure that the routers are not None before registering them.\n\n```python\nif analyzer_router is not None and coach_router is not None:\n    app.include_router(analyzer_router, prefix=\"/analyzer\")\n    app.include_router(coach_router, prefix=\"/coach\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Error: Analyzer or Coach router is not properly configured.\")\n```\n\n### Root Route\n\nThe root route is good, but consider adding a 404 error handler to provide a more informative response when a route is not found.\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import HTTPException\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_root():\n    return {\"message\": \"CodeMentor AI backend is running \"}\n\n@app.exception_handler(HTTPException)\nasync def http_exception_handler(request, exc):\n    return {\"error\": \"Not Found\", \"message\": exc.detail}\n```\n\n### Additional Suggestions\n\n1. **Use type hints**: Add type hints for function parameters and return types to improve code readability and enable better auto-completion in IDEs.\n2. **Consider using a configuration file**: Instead of hardcoding the CORS origins, consider using a configuration file (e.g., JSON or YAML) to store application settings.\n3. **Add logging**: Implement logging to track application events, such as route registrations and errors.\n4. **Use a more robust error handler**: Instead of a simple `HTTPException` handler, consider using a more",
